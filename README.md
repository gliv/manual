# A manual for working with Cliff

## What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?

- I'm an introvert. I need time with myself to recharge batteries and to think.
- I am a strong believer in autonomy. I want and give it.
- I am addicted to practicing and learning more about entrepreneurship, product management, engineering, design, UX, data-science and coding in general. It's what I do at work and on my own time. It's why I love my job üòç

## What are your quirks?

- I like my headphones and my music. It helps my flow. (see how to communicate)
- I commute ~1h to work every day . Crazy, eh? (PS: I work on the train. It's my main focus time)
- I'm Swissternational. Born Swiss, but citizen of the earth. Family and friends globally. Nations are bullshit.
- Oh, yes, I use strong language. (don't be offended, I just prefer clarity over political correctness)

## How can people earn an extra gold star with you?

- Doing the "right thing" (ethical connotation).
- Doing the "right thing" (practical connotation).
- Doing the things right (qualitative connotation).

## What qualities do you particularly value in people who work with you?

- Be a grown-up, self-starter, self-managing human being.
- Make mistakes. Learn.
- Ask questions (make less mistakes).
- Get shit done.

## What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?

- How should I know? I hardly understand myself üòÖ
- Okay on a more serious note: I might occasionally ignore you. I still love you. It's only about priorities. I'll catch up (or just ping me again).

## How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?

- As mentioned, *autonomy* is the starting point. I believe - in our fields of work - people want to do their best (*mastery*), I'll try to get out of the way for that. My whole job is around setting the *purpose* frame right. So basically I am making sure people have the autonomy they need, setting a meaningful purpose and getting out of the way for them to perform.
- I also believe I can short-circuit the "you must earn trust" conundrum by extending my trust first, unconditionally. It also guides my feedback. When I see something that harms the trust I extended, I am interested in getting the relationship back on track by giving feedback.
- "You can only lead a horse to the water, you can't make it drink."

## What‚Äôs the best way to communicate with you?

- Mostly async communication works great (Slack especially). I am often in meetings or trying to wrap my head around something, e.g. it's occasionally hard to get hold of me.
- However, I do want to talk to you and I do appreciate human-to-human interaction too üòÑIdeally as a 1:1. I find group meetings increasingly useless, unless there is a whiteboard involved.

## What‚Äôs the best way to convince you to do something?

- Show me the value for the user AND the business. I care about high-leverage stuff.
- And bribe me with sweets & coffee ‚òïÔ∏è

## How do you like to give feedback?

- In a 1:1 setting (structured)
- Whenever something needs immediate correction (ad-hoc, 1:1)
- Whenever the recipient did something great (ad-hoc, publicly)

## How do you like to get feedback?

- In a 1:1 setting (structured)
- Whenever something needs immediate correction (ad-hoc, 1:1)
- Whenever I did something great (ad-hoc, publicly)
